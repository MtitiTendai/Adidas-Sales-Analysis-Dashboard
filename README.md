# Amazon 2020-2021 Sales Analysis 
## Project objective
This project showcases a comprehensive sales analysis of Amazon data using Power BI. I built an interactive dashboard that examines sales performance across multiple dimensions, including product categories, regions and dates among other factors. The goal was to come up with visual analytics of sales between 2020 and 2021 to support strategic decision-making.
